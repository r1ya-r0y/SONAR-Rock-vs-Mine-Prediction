***Current Accuracy Analysis***

**Logistic Regression**

Training Accuracy: 83%

Testing Accuracy: 76%

Observations:
There is a noticeable drop in accuracy from training to testing data. This could indicate that the Logistic Regression model is overfitting, meaning it performs well on the training data but generalizes less effectively to new, unseen data.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Training Accuracy: 84%

Testing Accuracy: 81%

Observations:
The KNN model also shows a drop in accuracy from training to testing data, but the gap is slightly smaller compared to Logistic Regression. This suggests that KNN might be slightly better at generalizing to new data, but thereâ€™s still some overfitting.
